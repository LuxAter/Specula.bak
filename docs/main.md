# Introduction

Specula is a free, open source, cross-platform library for pathtracing. Specula
is written in C++, and implements a `lua`, and `python` interface. Using these
two methods of interfaceing with the library makes it very easy to generate new
scenes in a veriety of different scripting languages, then have them rendered
using the Specula library.

# Goals

The goals of Specula is to construct a physically based renderer which is easy
to embed in larger programs, but is also usable as a stand alone project.
