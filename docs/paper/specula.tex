\begin{abstract}
  The aim of this paper is to introduce the basic concepts of ray tracing, and
  lead the reader thought he entire process to construct a ray tracer from
  scratch. Once that has been achieved we will begin to introduce more involved
  components and develop a fully functioning path tracer that implements more
  complex features, such as BSSDF material shading, animated transformations,
  volumetric rendering, and other features. Any features that are our of the
  scope of this paper will be mentioned, and the structure will be such that
  additional features can easily be implemented.
