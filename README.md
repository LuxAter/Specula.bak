# Specula #

Download the package in any prefered way, either though the download links or
by running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuxAter/Specula
```

Then to compile, we recomend compiling an a seperate directory, so running the
following commands will produce an executable
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Once the program has been compiled, there will be an executable called
``main``, simply run that with the neccessary arguments to get started. A set
of example scenes are present in the ``examples`` directory. These are a good
place to start for creating your own custom scenes.
