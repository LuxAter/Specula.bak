 * @brief Standard `Vector` classes and operations
 *
 * This module implements three standard vector classes and several operations
 * that act on these types. Specifically this module implements `Vector2<T>`,
 * `Vector3<T>`, and `Vector4<T>`. These vectors are parametrized by the type of
 * the underlying element, making it possible to create vectors of both integer
 * and floating-point types.
