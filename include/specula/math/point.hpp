 * @brief Standard `Point` classes and operations
 *
 * This module implements three standard point classes and several operations
 * that act on these types. Specifically this module implements `Point2<T>`,
 * `Point3<T>`, and `Point4<T>`.
 *
 * A point is a zero-dimensional location in 2D, 3D or 4D space. The Point2,
 * Point3, and Point4 classes represent points in the obcious way: using \f$x,
 * y, z, w\f$(in 4D) coordinates with respect to a coordinate system. Although
 * the same representation is used for vectors, hte fact that a point represents
 * a position wheras a vector represents a direction leads to a number of
 * important differences in how they are treated.
